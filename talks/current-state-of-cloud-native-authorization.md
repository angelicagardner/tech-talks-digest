- Lots of technologies, models and vendors in the authorization landscape. Navigating this ecosystem requires understanding different models and approaches.
- Modern best practices include: purpose-built authorization services, fine-grained access control, separation of authorization logic from application code, real-time access checks, and centralized decision logging.
- The speaker is from Aserto which is a modern authorization solution that aims to provide fine-grained, policy-based, real-time access control. It integrates easily with existing identity providers and development workflows. Aserto leverages the Topaz open-source project.
