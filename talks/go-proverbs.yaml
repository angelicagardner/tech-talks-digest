**Speaker(s):** Rob Pike

**Video URL:** https://youtu.be/PAAkCSZUG1c

**Summary:** The speaker draws inspiration from the poetic proverbs of the board game Go to propose a similar set of concise, memorable sayings for the Go programming language - each encapsulating a core design principle or best practice. The aim is to make learning and teaching Go more intuitive and community-driven.
