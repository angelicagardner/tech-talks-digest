<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This talk compares two Kubernetes “agent-only” operators for Prometheus metric collection: the community-maintained Prometheus Operator and Google’s Managed Service for Prometheus (GMP) Operator. Both operators hide complex scrape configs behind custom resources, but the Prometheus Operator uses deployment-based sharding and gives you full back-end features (querying, alerting, HA), whereas GMP runs a daemonset per node for a lightweight, stateless collector that’s built into GKE.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prometheus Operator deploys Prometheus as Deployments with sharding, supports full back-end capabilities (querying, alerting, HA), and uses PodMonitor/ServiceMonitor CRDs.</li>
<li>GMP Operator runs Prometheus as a DaemonSet on each node for stateless collection, offers simpler CRDs, and integrates out-of-the-box with GKE (enabled by default when create new GKE cluster).</li>
<li>Both operators simplify scrape configuration, automate target discovery status reporting, and forward metrics via remote-write to Thanos, Cortex or vendor back-ends.</li>
<li>Choose the Prometheus Operator for a full-featured self-managed stack; choose GMP Operator for a lightweight, managed collection agent in cloud-native environments.</li>
<li>GMP Operator is an agent-only scraper ("collection-focused") which means that it collects metrics and remote-write them to whatever long-term storage or managed Prometheus service you’ve chosen, but it leaves the storage, querying, alerting, and UI entirely to that downstream system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions/Discussion Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>It would be interesting to compare with other operator patterns such as OpenTelemetry Collector (as a Prometheus scraper), Thanos Operator / Cortex Operator (deploy Prometheus instances alongside long-term storage backends) or Cluster Monitoring Operator (the de-facto way in OpenShift) which is built on top of the Prometheus Operator and adds cluster-wide defaults and multi-tenant isolation.</li>
</ul>
