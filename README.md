# Tech Talks Digest

## About

This repo is dedicated to summarizing tech talks from various conferences. Each includes a summary, timestamps, video link, key takeaways, and potential discussion topics about the idea(s) presented. The goal for this repo is to serve as a resource (for myself) to store and quickly get the essence of these talks.

## Repository Setup

### Viewing the Summaries

The talks are displayed on a GitHub Pages site that contains a table linking to individual Markdown files for each talk. These files are located in the `/talks` directory.

### Adding a New Talk

1. **Open Issues**: If there's an interesting talk not yet summarized, it will appear as an open Issue. The issues follow an Issue Template.
2. **After Watching**: The talk will be summarized in a new Markdown file in the `/talks` directory under the "dev" branch. The Markdown file should follow the setup in `talks/_example.md`.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Once the summary is ready, a pull request can be created and merged to the main branch. It's important to mention the associated issue using `#issue_number` format in the pull request - this will trigger a workflow that adds the same issue labels to the PR.
4. **GitHub Actions**: The merged changes will trigger a Workflow that updates the webpage so the new talk is added to the table.
