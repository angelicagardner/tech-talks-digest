<p><strong>Speaker(s):</strong> Daniel Gomez Blanco</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This talk is about explaining that in today’s complex, distributed systems you can no longer debug by intuition and isolated metrics alone - you need rich, standards-based context propagated end‐to‐end. By adopting OpenTelemetry’s unified model for metrics, traces and logs, teams gain data ("evidence") instead of guesswork and can correlate user experience across services.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>By propagating OpenTelemetry’s trace context end-to-end we get concrete evidence rather than relying on hunches when debugging.</li>
<li>Leverage metrics, traces, and logs for their intended purposes but also correlate them via exemplars and semantic conventions.</li>
<li>Use head sampling for low-overhead probabilistic trace capture, and tail sampling (via a collector) to focus on the most interesting traces (errors, high-latency) without losing end-to-end context.</li>
<li>Keep metrics cardinality low and use “metric views” at runtime to reshape or filter out unbounded labels, ensuring performant long-term storage and querying.</li>
<li>Use telemetry to prove ROI and guide leadership decisions by tying service-level indicators (SLIs/SLOs) back to real user-experience and business KPIs.</li>
<li>We learn by doing so it's a good idea to guide engineers to adoption through live labs or “observability game days,” making it easy—and fun—for to experience the value of context-driven debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions/Discussion Points</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easy talk to follow along, kind of like an overview/intro to OpenTelemetry’s APIs and SDKs. I would say the recommended audience is Platform/SRE/DevOps engineers who want to move from ad-hoc metrics to a unified, standards-based approach - or engineering leads/architects looking to align multiple teams around a common telemetry model.</li>
</ul>
