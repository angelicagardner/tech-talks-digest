<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Inclusion means making everyone valued, heard, respected and empowered so they can feel a true sense of beloning. This includes gender, age, sex but also location.</li>
<li>In a 'remote' scenario, there is a central hub and the rest are considered peripherals. Conversely, in a 'distributed' model, all locations are treated as integral parts of the team, promoting equality and inclusivity.</li>
<li>When hiring for a Distributed Team, hire generalists rather than specialists.</li>
<li>Adopt distributed practices for building effective distributed teams, for example proactive communication and transparency, ensuring that all team members are aligned and informed about decisions and changes. This includes using tools that support the practices.</li>
<li>Tactics for Proactive Written Communication: Decision Notes, Call Notes, #worklog.</li>
<li>Requirements for a Post-Commit Code Review: Correct tools to support post-commit and potential rollback when issues are found, high Test Coverage, Responsible People and Trust!</li>
</ul>
